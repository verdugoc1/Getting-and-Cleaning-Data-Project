# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. Upload your data set as a txt file created with write.table() using row.name=FALSE

## Contributing

If you've created a web page, video, slideshow, or any other kind of media you think should be shared through this directory you should:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Add a link to your content on the appropriate course page.
3. Commit your changes. 
4. Submit a pull request.

We've created a [sample pull request](https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/DataScienceSpecialization.github.io/pull/1) to show you what we would like to see in a pull request. If we think your creation is well made, informative, and adds something new to this repository of content then we'll merge your request and add you to our list of contributors. If you happen to notice any inaccuracies or idiosyncrasies on this site or in this site's content, please let us know by opening an issue.

**If you are not the author of the content you are submitting** you are welcome to add your link to the [Curated Knowledge](http://datasciencespecialization.github.io/curated/) page. We've created this page specifically so that you can share data science resources that you've found useful.

**Otherwise if you *are* the author of the content you're submitting** you should ask yourself the following questions:

1. Does my contribution teach?
2. Does the content of my contribution clearly address topics in the Data Science Specialization?
3. Could my contribution be seamlessly integrated into the canonical course materials?

If you're on the fence about any of these, err on the side of sending a pull request!
